CURRENTLY at 18:30 in "getting data for profile components" video. it's a recap that shows how easy it is.
use componentwillmount (profile.js to do get request (look at 11:06 or 19:51), which hits the controller 
(see 19:40 but it doesnt have to be usercontroller), which returns sets the state variable userprofile to 
set the state in profile.js and populate the page


pagination / lazy loading

likes

deleting comments

posts aren't deleting if they are from a previous session




usernames in posts/comments should link to that user's profile
    ***DONE ***

finish bio in profile area

delete posts/comments
    *** deleting posts is done ***



- subscribe the postArea to database changes
    -probably involves passing a function down from index to Compose that can 
    change a value in the state of postArea so that it renders
    -router might fix this

UPDATE - router will help it. new parent component 'Home' can handle that.
