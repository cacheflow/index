CURRENTLY at 18:30 in "getting data for profile components" video. it's a recap that shows how easy it is.
use componentwillmount (profile.js to do get request (look at 11:06 or 19:51), which hits the controller 
(see 19:40 but it doesnt have to be usercontroller), which returns sets the state variable userprofile to 
set the state in profile.js and populate the page


- subscribe the postArea to database changes
    -probably involves passing a function down from index to Compose that can 
    change a value in the state of postArea so that it renders
    -router might fix this

UPDATE - router will help it. new parent component 'Home' can handle that.

- images
    -react-filepond on the main page and the user registration / user profile pages
        **** added regular image_url field in registration page ***
    -allow for captions (the 'title' from the current setup)
    -microsoft vision captioning???
